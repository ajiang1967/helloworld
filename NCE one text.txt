Lesson 109 A good idea

Shall I make some coffee, Jane?
That's a good idea, Charlotte.
It's ready.
Do you want any milk?
Just a little, please.
what about some sugar?
Two teaspoonfuls?
No, less than that.
One and a half teaspoonfuls, please.
That's enough for me.
That was very nice.
Would you like some more?
Yes, please.
I'd like a cigarette, too.
May I have one?
Of course.
I think there are a few in that box.
I'm afraid it's empty.
What a pity!
It dosen't matter.
Have a biscuit instead.
Eat more and smoke less!
That's very good advice!


Lesson 111 The most expensive model

I like this television very much.
How much does it cost?
It's the most expensive model in the shop.
It costs five hundred pounds.
That's too expensive for us.
We can't afford all that money.
This model's less expensive than that one.
It's only three hundred pounds.
But, of course, it's not as good as the expensive one.
I don't like this model.
The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.
Can we buy it on instalments?
Of course.
You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds, and then fourteen pounds a month for three years.
Do you like it, dear?
I certainly do, but I don't like the price.
You always want the best, but we can't afford it.
Sometimes you think you're a millionaire!
Millionaires don't buy things on instalments!


Lesson 113 Small change

Fares, please!
Trafalgar Square, please.
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't change a ten-pound note.
Haven't you got any small change?
I've got no small change, I'm afraid.
I'll ask some of the passengers.
Have you any small change, sir?
I'm sorry.
I've got none.
I haven't got any either.
Can you change this ten-pound note, madam?
I'm afraid I can't.
Neither can I.
I'm very sorry, sir.
You must get off the bus.
None of our passengers can change this note.
They're all millionaires!
Except us.
I've got some small change.
So have I.
